\mframe{The Schrödinger Equation}{The time-independent Schrödinger equation}{
	The time-independent Schröinger equation is given by
	\begin{empheq}[box={\mybluebox[5pt]}]{equation}
		\hat{\mathcal{H}}\Psi_n=\varepsilon_n\Psi_n,
	\end{empheq}
	with $\hat{\mathcal{H}}$ as the Hamiltonian, $\Psi_n$ as the wave function and $\varepsilon_n$ as the corresponding energy \cite{schrodinger_undulatory_1926}. 
}
\note{Here, we have a basic slide with subtitle}

\mframe{The Probability Distribution}{}{
	The probability distribution in quantum mechanics is given by
	\begin{empheq}[box={\mybluebox[5pt]}]{equation}
		P(\boldsymbol{r})=\frac{\Psi_n(\boldsymbol{r})^*\Psi_n(\boldsymbol{r})}{\int d\boldsymbol{r}\Psi_n(\boldsymbol{r})^*\Psi_n(\boldsymbol{r})},
	\end{empheq}
	where $\boldsymbol{r}$ is a set of spatial and spin coordinates \cite{born_zur_1926}.
	\pause
	However, often the wave function is assumed to be normalized, and the equation is simply written as
	\begin{equation}
	P(\boldsymbol{r})=\Psi_n(\boldsymbol{r})^*\Psi_n(\boldsymbol{r}),
	\end{equation}
	\note<1>{Here is a basic slide without a subtitle.}
	\note<2>{The pause function can be used to add more elements to a slide}
